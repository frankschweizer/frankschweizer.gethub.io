				<h3>Bio</h3>
				<p>My background and talent go together out of necessity. I never really knew that we had little money as a child. I was blessed with Dad who stayed at home with me. Mom was out working all of the time. She worked as a school teacher who would take every after school opportunity to help students, but she also to earned money for the family. Dad took me everywhere with him. I watched what he did and learned by doing with him. One of my favorite things was being outside in Nature. The great thing about being inside was learning how to cook. Since I was a child, I had a passion for building things and for cooking. My favorite cartoon was Bob the Builder. I also liked watching Emeril and Good Eats. This came in handy when my Dad became more disabled and I would help with the cooking. I also helped take care of my sister and brother until Mom came home. This made me become very responsible and self-assured. I have lived in nine different places since birth. We lived in a nice neighborhood until my sister came around. It was a one bedroom apartment in Staten Island, New York. After that we moved to the North side of Staten Island into a neighborhood that would be considered the “hood”. My mom took the Ferry back and forth from Manhattan where she taught. It was too expensive for Pre-K, so I was not able to attend. My Dad taught me at home. There were wild dogs running around outside in this neighborhood. It was rather dangerous. In the middle of one night, I became a resident of Pennsylvania. My mother’s parents drove up to get my sister and after the local drug dealer tried to break in to get at the upstairs neighbor who evidently owed him money.</p>
				<p>At the age of three I did not know much about this. My mom and Dad visited us on weekends until summer when my mom had vacation. My parents rented a townhouse and we all moved into it. It was not far from Grandma and Grandpa. My brother was born that summer in Pennsylvania. It was nice there. I still went with Dad to construction sites. I liked playing outside. We went shopping and did the cooking. Mom still worked in New York City. She came home pretty late. Sometimes, I did not get to see her until the next evening. One day the doorbell rang and I answered it. It was someone looking for the next door neighbor to buy marijuana. It was a weekend because Mom was home. People tried to steal my toys off of the patio. Mom found a tiny, cheap house for sale and we moved into it. It was pretty safe. It was the biggest house that I had ever lived in. We had to evacuate once due to severe flooding during a hurricane. One of the best things about this house was that it was on a dead end. I played outside all of the time. There was a fair amount of wildlife there as well. There was even the opportunity for me to learn to cook outdoors. I developed a love for smoking meats. At a young age I became enamored with cookbooks by Bobby Flay.</p>  
				<p>During this time, I attended three different schools. Two were Christian schools. One was too far away from the house we bought. The other closed. After that, I went to Public school. The junior high school had a student population of around one thousand students.  My interest in cooking and outdoors remained. At this school, I became an avid soccer player. I remained a Boy Scout. Unfortunately, my mother was injured at work by a student and life would once again change.</p>
				<p>Mom had a head injury and also needed surgery on her hand. She was dizzy for a year and a half. Mom suffered aphasia. With Mom not working, we could not afford the house. We were welcomed into my grandparents’ home. The only problem was that there were five of us plus two cats and our dog living in one bedroom. On a positive note, my grandmother loved to cook. I learned much about Italian dishes from her. She had home dialysis which my grandfather did. They would watch cooking shows during this time. I was able to continue in the same school and play sports. I kept active with boy scouts. We needed to leave after about a year. We were not able to find cheap enough housing near there
					Mom did a lot of research on schools for us and for employment as well. We had been introduced to Acadia National Park by my grandparents. We would go camping there in the summertime. My Dad’s parents gave him some money so that we could rent a house in Maine. Mom found an academy that we could attend for free. She cased in all of her life insurance policies to tide us over till she found work.</p>
				<p>We move to Maine for September 1, 2012. I started as a freshman at George Stevens Academy. It was a tremendous leap of faith that we all took together. My dad volunteered at the school in the library. I became a cross country runner. This year we are Maine State Champions. My mom became completely certified in Maine to teach. She could not find a job. We picked up pinecones to sell. She worked as a Behavior Health Professional, and she also volunteered at the school. My sister and brother did well in school too. Life was good although hard. My mom had a discount card for the Goodwill. I learned not to be embarrassed about our situation. We continued to donate what we did not need to the Emmaus Homeless Shelter. I did give up boy scouts when we moved to Maine. I have instead hiked on the Appalachian Trail and twice summited Mt. Kathadin. I have learned to ice skate and ski. I know also play tennis. I have devoted through volunteering countless hours to raise money for my school’s outing outdoors club. I am sponsoring a road race on trails that I built with my best friend. I bake pies for a church other than my own to distribute to the less fortunate. I assist in an organization which does good deeds and raises money. </p>
